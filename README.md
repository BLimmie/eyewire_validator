# Eyewire Validation

## Abstract
Eyewire is a citizen science game where players map individual neurons in a rat's retina. Using a relatively new method of deep learning called Bayesian Deep Learning, I create an agent to approximate the individual tasks (a.k.a. cubes) that human players complete as part of Eyewire. The architecture used in the model is a recurrent encoder-decoder network for 3D images. 3D images pose a huge challenge in memory/size restrictions, so methods dealing with those had to be engineered.
